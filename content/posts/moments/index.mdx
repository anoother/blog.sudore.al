Architects like to talk about *moments*; To translate space into time, and portion out slivers whenever a happening presents itself. Architecture is, after all, about the reading of space, and reading is a linearised activity. The draftsman’s world is thus collapsed, from the third dimension down to the second on his drawing board, or to the first in this sense of narrative—These stories with which spaces speak to us.

For those melancholic at heart, these moments speak especially loud. Against the mundanity and the drudgery of being, beauty is something which punctuates. It punctures the fabric of this world with specks of light as stars against the night sky, reminding us that all beauty is divine in origin; That it belongs here only as we do… Limited by time; Slivers of happening.
