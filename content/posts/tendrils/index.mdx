This is a post about attachment. Not of, or to, anything in particular; rather, attachment as a substance, a medium, of its own. An essence that links people to things, or bridges between them. An invisible yet emotionally palpable ether.

I've always found myself forming such attachments naturally. Objects assiociated with memories, memories with feelings. Inexorabably linked through time.

As I live, I shed seeds of these attachments around me, dropping them on things, people or thoughts. And, in time, they grow tendrils of their own, cob-webbing across the environment. So, I find myself repelled from places, or from actions, or from attachments themselves â€” because they're associated to things that once repelled me.

I don't know whether this is natural. And I don't think it's healthy.

In Ramadan, I managed to overcome one such attachment; to step through its brush and climb. It was an overwhelmingly positive experience, not least due to the sanctity of the month itself. Ramadan brings us closer to our true, potential, selves. I think it's time for me to shed my attachment to attachments. To prune, and to nurture them.

My new hope is a higher-order understanding. To retain lessons, and opposed to images. There's so much emotion bundled up, into so much of what I do, that seeing things for what they are is often difficult. I'm learning to see the tendrils for what they are; to surpass and to sever them when needed.

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. Do you grow tendrils, too? A comments section isn't something this blog possesses, right now, but it will come. Until then, Twitter.
